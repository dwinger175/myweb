		<!-- General Information about me -->
		
	<h2> About </h2>
		<p>I have lived in <strong>Northwest Ohio</strong> for my entire life. Before coming to Four County,
			I went to <em> Fairview </em>. While I was there, I was an all A student and excelled at school. 
			I came to Four County to learn more about game design and hopefully get a career in it. 
			I am currently in <a href="https://mrgeiger.com/" title="Mr Geiger site">Mr Geiger's </a> class.
			Below is a game i made in said class

		<!-- My hobbies and favorite activities -->
		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		
			<p> I enjoy playing <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/" title="Pokemon Showdown"> Pokemon Showdown </a>. 
			It is a competitive pokemon game with an extremely complex battle system. I also enjoy collecting. My collections
			include Pokemon Cards, Funko Pops, and Comic Books. I have probably put a couple hundred dollars into each collection.
			Lastly, legos are a favorite hobby of mine. I enjoy building and taking apart models, and making contraptions. </p>
		
		
		<h2> Other </h2>
		
		<p>
		I hope to learn more about different programming languages this to eventually become a game designer.
		This is a goal of mine because I love to imagine what my dream game would be, and it would be amazing to
		have that dream come to life. I hope you enjoyed my website, come visit again soon.</p>
